# Context Architecture System™ — v0.6.2

The owned context layer beneath your AI tools.

**CAS is an open framework** — a file/folder standard for structured, portable, versioned knowledge that any AI model, agent, or tool can read. You own it. It lives in files. It outlives any vendor, model, or workflow engine.

> The WordPress:Automattic analogy: CAS is the open standard. [Context Arcana™](https://contextarcana.com) is the implementation partnership.

## Read first

**[`PRINCIPLES.md`](PRINCIPLES.md)** — the ten principles that govern the Context Architecture System. The rest of this repository is in service of them.

---

## What this is

A minimal, Git-tracked folder structure for keeping your business context in files you own. No app. No database. No vendor lock-in.

- Works with Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, local models, or anything that can read a file
- Paste `SETUP_PROMPT.md` into any AI assistant to activate it immediately
- Version everything with Git

## Quick start

> **Want to start your own shell?** Use the minimal starter template — it contains only what you need, none of the framework machinery.
>
> **→ [github.com/context-arcana-llc/cas-shell-template](https://github.com/context-arcana-llc/cas-shell-template)**

> **Want to see what a populated shell looks like first?** Browse [`examples/riverstone-coffee/`](examples/riverstone-coffee/) — a fictional small business with every major folder filled in.

1. **Use the template** — click "Use this template" on [cas-shell-template](https://github.com/context-arcana-llc/cas-shell-template)
2. **Install the git hooks** (one-time, per clone) — run `bash setup.sh` (macOS / Linux) or `.\setup.ps1` (Windows PowerShell)
3. **Fill in `CONTEXT.md`** — update the YAML frontmatter with your name, type (`personal`, `business`, or `commercial`), domain, and today's date
4. **Activate with your AI** — paste the contents of `SETUP_PROMPT.md` into a new conversation
5. **Start adding context** — drop files into the appropriate `context/` subfolder

## Folder layout

| Folder | What lives here |
|---|---|
| `context/00_index/` | Master index of what's in your context system |
| `context/01_identity/` | Brand, voice, mission, founding story |
| `context/02_operations/` | How the business runs — processes, tools, accounts |
| `context/03_offers/` | Products, services, pricing, positioning |
| `context/04_clients/` | Client records, relationships, history |
| `context/05_assets/` | Reusable copy, templates, media references |
| `context/06_workflows/` | Step-by-step processes and SOPs |
| `context/07_decisions/` | Decision records and rationale |
| `context/08_prompts/` | Working prompts, calibrated instructions |
| `context/09_outputs/` | Notable AI outputs worth keeping |
| `context/99_archive/` | Retired content — kept for reference |
| `templates/` | Blank templates for new context entries |

---

## Specification

The `spec/` directory contains the formal CAS specifications. These define what a valid shell looks like and are the basis for the `cas validate` command (coming in v0.5.0).

| Document | What it defines |
|---|---|
| [`spec/shell-body.md`](spec/shell-body.md) | The Shell/Body model — personal, business, and commercial shell types |
| [`spec/manifest-schema.md`](spec/manifest-schema.md) | YAML frontmatter schema for `CONTEXT.md` |
| [`spec/required-files.md`](spec/required-files.md) | Which files and directories must be present in a valid shell |
| [`spec/commercial-shell.md`](spec/commercial-shell.md) | The `shell/` directory structure for commercial shells |

---

## Validator

```bash
cd cli && npm install
node bin/cas.js validate /path/to/your/shell
```

Or validate the current directory:

```bash
node bin/cas.js validate
```

The validator checks your shell against the spec and reports PASS, WARN, or FAIL for each rule. Exit code 0 on pass, 1 on failure — works in CI.

---

## Secret hygiene

The included git hooks scan staged content and refuse anything that looks like a secret or PII before it can be committed or pushed.

**What's blocked:** API keys, tokens, private key blocks, JWTs, SSNs, credit card numbers, IBANs, driver's license labels, labeled account/routing numbers.

Install once with `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`. Binary files (images, PDFs) are skipped by the scanner.
